For MuleSoft Training 
This is the solution for the problem statement provided by Mulesoft.
You need to open Xampp and then open localhost.
I am thankful to Mulesoft for providing this opportunity to me. 
The solution to the problems are solved using php with mysql.
Code for the fetch and pushing our data into database by using php GET operation.
NOTE: Since all the solution is on one page there are 2 submit buttons in the output please execute each at a time press back and then press another submit button.
Ignore the warnings since codes are not separated and on one page with same variable names used.
Output for the codes are perfect regardless of warnings.
